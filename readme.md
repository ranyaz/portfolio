Do you want to play Tic Tac Toe?



1. How to play:

The object of Tic Tac Toe is very simple: get three in a row.

The game is designed on a three by three board.

The first player is known as X and the second is O.

Players will alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board.

The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a

horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

You have to keep playing until all nine squares are filled.

If no one get three in a row, it is a tie and you can start over again!



2. Strategy

- Win: If the player has two in a row, they can place a third to get three in a row.

- Block: If the opponent has two in a row, the player must play the third themselves to block the opponent.

- Fork: Create an opportunity where the player has two threats to win (two non-blocked lines of 2).

- Blocking an opponent's fork:
   * Option 1 =  The player should create two in a row to force the opponent into defending, as long as it doesn't result in them creating a fork. For example, if "X" has a corner, "O" has the center, and "X" has the opposite corner as well, "O" must not play a corner in order to win. (Playing a corner in this scenario creates a fork for "X" to win.)

  * Option 2: If there is a configuration where the opponent can fork, the player should block that fork.

  * Center: A player marks the center. (If it is the first move of the game, playing on a corner gives "O" more opportunities to make a mistake and may therefore be the better choice; however, it makes no difference between perfect players.)

  * Opposite corner: If the opponent is in the corner, the player plays the opposite corner.

  * Empty corner: The player plays in a corner square.

  * Empty side: The player plays in a middle square on any of the 4 sides.



3. The name

The first print reference to "Noughts and crosses", the British name, appeared in 1864.
In his novel "Can You Forgive Her", 1864, Anthony Trollope refers to a clerk playing "tit-tat-toe".

The first print reference to a game called "tick-tack-toe" occurred in 1884, but referred to "a children's game played on a slate, consisting in trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored".

"Tic-tac-toe" may also derive from "tick-tack", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The U.S. renaming of Noughts and crosses as Tic-tac-toe occurred in the 20th century.
